# hydrophone

![Kubernetes Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray/master/docs/img/kubernetes-logo.png)

Lightweight runner for kubernetes tests. Uses the conformance image(s) released by
the kubernetes release team to either run individual tests or the entire [Conformance suite].
Design is pretty simple, it starts the conformance image as a pod in the `conformance`
namespace, waits for it to finish and then prints out the results.

## Build

```
$ make build
go build -o bin/hydrophone main.go
```

## Install

```
go install github.com/dims/hydrophone@latest
```

## Command line options

```
$ bin/hydrophone --help
Usage of bin/hydrophone:
  -busybox-image string
        specify an alternate busybox container image. (default "registry.k8s.io/e2e-test-images/busybox:1.36.1-1")
  -cleanup
        cleanup resources (pods, namespaces etc).
  -conformance
        run conformance tests.
  -conformance-image string
        specify a conformance container image of your choice. (default "registry.k8s.io/conformance:v1.29.0")
  -dry-run
        run in dry run mode.
  -focus string
        focus runs a specific e2e test. e.g. - sig-auth. allows regular expressions.
  -kubeconfig string
        path to the kubeconfig file.
  -list-images
        list all images that will be used during conformance tests.
  -output-dir string
        directory for logs. (defaults to current directory)
  -parallel int
        number of parallel threads in test framework. (default 1)
  -skip string
        skip specific tests. allows regular expressions.
  -test-repo string
        alternate registry for test images
  -test-repo-list string
        yaml file to override registries for test images
  -verbosity int
        verbosity of test framework. (default 4)
```

## Run

Ensure there is a `KUBECONFIG` environment variable specified or `$HOME/.kube/config` file present before running `hydrophone` Alternatively, you can specify the path to the kubeconfig file with the `--kubeconfig` option.

To run conformance tests use:
```
bin/hydrophone --conformance
```

To run a specific test use:
```
bin/hydrophone --focus 'Simple pod should contain last line of the log'
```

To specify a version of conformance image use:
```
bin/hydrophone --conformance-image 'registry.k8s.io/conformance:v1.29.0'
```

## Troubleshooting

Check if the pod is running:
```
kubectl get pods -n conformance
```

use `kubectl logs` or `kubectl exec` to see what is happening in the pod.

## Cleanup

Delete the pod
```
kubectl delete -n conformance pods/e2e-conformance-test
```

Delete the namespace
```
kubectl delete -n conformance pods/e2e-conformance-test && kubectl delete ns conformance
```
