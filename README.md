# hydrophone

![Kubernetes Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray/master/docs/img/kubernetes-logo.png)

Lightweight runner for kubernetes tests. Uses the conformance image(s) released by
the kubernetes release team to either run individual tests or the entire [Conformance suite].
Design is pretty simple, it starts the conformance image as a pod in the `conformance`
namespace, waits for it to finish and then prints out the results.

### Project Goals

- **Simplified Kubernetes Testing**: Easy-to-use tool for running Kubernetes conformance tests.
- **Official Conformance Images**: Utilize official conformance images from the Kubernetes Release Team.
- **Flexible Test Execution**: Ability to run individual test, the entire Conformance Test Suite, or anything in between.

### Project Non-Goals

- **Replacing Kubernetes Testing Frameworks**: Not intended to replace existing frameworks, but to complement them.
- **Extensive Test Development**: Focus is on running existing tests, not developing new ones.
- **Broad Tool Integration**: Limited integration with third-party tools; maintains simplicity.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Go installed on your system and the `GOPATH` is set. You will also need access to a Kubernetes cluster.

### Install

Install Hydrophone using the following command:

```bash
$ go install sigs.k8s.io/hydrophone@latest
```

Alternatively you can download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/hydrophone/releases)

### Running Tests


Ensure there is a `KUBECONFIG` environment variable specified or `$HOME/.kube/config` file present before running `hydrophone` Alternatively, you can specify the path to the kubeconfig file with the `--kubeconfig` option.

To run conformance tests use:

```bash
$ bin/hydrophone --conformance
```

To run a specific test use:

```bash
$ bin/hydrophone --focus 'Simple pod should contain last line of the log'
```

To specify a version of conformance image use:

```bash
$ bin/hydrophone --conformance-image 'registry.k8s.io/conformance:v1.31.2'
```
